                    <h1>Evolution Of Pop</h1>
                    <p> 
                        <br>
                        Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.
                        The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. <br><br>
                        Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.
                        Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music.
                        Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to.
                        Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.

                    <h1>Technological Impact on Pop Music</h1>
                    <p> 
                        In the last two centuries, technology has advanced in ways that were previously unimaginable. 
                        In both <b>positive & negative</b> ways, they have changed the way music is made, delivered, and accessible. Since the 18th century, there have been several technical improvements in music, but digitalization of music has been the most significant. 
                        It has been a major shift in the music industry's dynamics and economics since music can be read by computers. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Improved Production</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the instruments to the recording process, music creation has never been greater.
                        In the last two centuries, musical instruments have improved and evolved, capturing the attention of anybody with a keen ear for music. 
                        For example, the Electric Guitar, which would go on to have enormous cultural impact, was born in the 1920s. There were many innovators and artists that tried to think outside the box in order to produce louder string sounds by employing electricity. 
                        Once it hit the big time, millions of people all around the world began to hear it and love it. <br><br>
                    
                    </p>
                    <h3>Promotion</h3>

                    <p>
                        In the early 2000s, musicians would appear on shows like Top of the Pops, chart shows, and even in magazines and newspapers to promote their newest singles. 
                        It has become easier for musicians to get their music into the hands of consumers via viral videos and social media posts. 
                        Consider Canadian sensation Justin Bieber, who was signed to a record company almost immediately after being found by talent manager Scooter Braun through Bieber's YouTube account in 2008. 
                        A few years later, Bieber became one of the world's most popular performers.

                    <h3>Piracy</h3>
                    <p>As a result of how music is discovered and consumed today, there is also a detrimental side effect to the music industry's overwhelming reliance on technology. 
                        Piracy has cost artists and businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue. <br><br>

                        The way we listen to music has undergone a radical transformation. 
                        Our mobile devices now allow us to access millions of songs through subscriptions to internet streaming platforms rather than downloading them from sites like LimeWire or relying on the enormous demand for MP3 players in the early noughties. 
                        Sales of CDs in the United Kingdom fell from 132 million in 2008 to 32 million in 2018, a dramatic reduction. <br><br>
                        
                        However, recent years have seen an increase in the speed at which this paradigm shift has progressed. 
                        There was a time when Spotify had 30 million paying customers throughout the world, but by 2019 that number had more than tripled to almost 100 million. 
                        Apple Music, which launched in 2015 and currently boasts 60 million paying subscribers worldwide, has a similar story.

                    <h1>Pop & Lifestyle</h1>
                    <p> 
                        <br>
                        As one of the most popular genres of music, pop music and popular artists have a big influence on today's society.
                        One of the most significant ways that pop music has influenced the cultural landscape is through its ability to break down barriers and bring people together. <br><br>
                        Pop music has always been a force for social change, bringing different cultures and groups together and helping to break down barriers of prejudice and intolerance. 
                        Many pop artists act as public figures and role models for many people and they have huge power in the industry to influence and spread important messages to others.

                        Oneof the most famous singers of the 1950's was Elvis Presley, who brought notjust rock and roll in music but also in fashion. Bedazzled jumpsuits, detailedcapes, pink shirts, and skin tight leather pants screamed attention of all thefashionistas. <br><br>
                        The 1960's fashion trends made popular by the Beatles, saw modsuits, long kurta styled paisley shirts, and floral pants, and needless tomention a burst of bright colors and wide collars.
                        Many pop stars have come up with their own line of clothing in the past ten years. Gwen Stefani, Miley Cyrus, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Fergie, Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Katy Perry to name a few have ventured into the business of fashion. 
                        Jessica Simpson has made it big and is estimated to have made retail sales worth $ 750 million in the year 2010. The singer has more than 650 stores across America and an affordable line of fashion clothing.
